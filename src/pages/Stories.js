                    Ha Ma set up a page in mid-August 2019, but officially drew more and more often on days of social isolation due to Covid influence.
                    At that time, a person with an almost full week work schedule like me, always felt like I didn't have time, suddenly time became abundant.
                    Of course, the first thing I did during the quarantine days was at home playing, cooking and reading stories.
                    Then I came up with the 100-day challenge.
                    So every day an official drawing begins... üòä

                    A close friend once said: My paintings always bring him a feeling of peace and comfort.
                    So he brought his painting to the drawing society. My first drawing received a lot of likes and comments.
                    I feel joy in my heart. I can't wait until every afternoon to upload pictures and wait to read your comments that I have never known...

                    "On days of isolation like this, it makes me feel so light to see paintings". 
                    I stopped for a long time at that comment. Turns out, the pictures I draw can soothe the soul...
                    That's why when I post pictures, I always include the caption with the lyrics of the song I'm listening to and a heart sticker.
                    I want to send you more than just a picture... ‚ù§Ô∏è

                    Later, when I was teaching drawing, I had the opportunity to meet many sisters and friends.
                    I discovered that each of us, everyone has hidden corners, pressures, emotions, wounds ... deep in the soul.
                    And most people come to paint to relax or heal...

                    And then I decided to build a house for Ha Ma.
                    I hope that this place will give you a comfortable and relaxing drawing space and will be a place where you find inner peace.

                                    After two weeks of opening the drawing-room, I received a lot of joy from the positive feedback, with the experiences when going through the first sessions with everyone.
                                    <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Initially, the intention to open a drawing-room came from the fact that I wanted to have a "place to go" to meet and share watercolors with everyone.
                                    Because 7 years ago, when I practiced watercolor, I found a very good balance of mind before everything, felt rich in energy and had a lot of love for life.
                                    <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    "Nowadays, we are all worried and stressed after working hours, it is extremely necessary to relieve anxiety for a long time. If everyone can find the same love and passion as me back then, Or simply really "standing still" for a few hours, drawing the first pictures with the first emotions is very meaningful. I really thought so.
                                    <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Life is finite, but joy and happiness are infinite things, no matter what time we can find it again, with all that has been and is happening. üñ§
